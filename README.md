# Churn-Prediction-and-Explainable-AI-Dashboard
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning models and provide transparent, interpretable insights into the model's decision-making process through Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
